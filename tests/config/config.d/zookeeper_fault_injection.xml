    <!-- Settings for fault injection.
         Approximate probability of request success:
             (1 - send_fault_probability) * (1 - recv_fault_probability) = 0.9999 * 0.9999 = 0.9998
         Actually it will be less, because if some request fails due to fault injection,
         then all requests which are in the queue now also fail.
         In other words, session will expire approximately 2 times per 10000 requests.
